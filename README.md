- Update output path if prompted to do so else go ahead and run the server class.
- You will be met with a configuration screen, set up your preferences.
- remember you preferred port number and ip address as this is needed to run the clien.
- Once done, Open the client class and edit the client's Run Configuration.
- On the edit screen, under program arguments paste the ip address and port number from the server.

You may face problems with classes & packages not being recognized as classes & packages.
### Let's fix it:
- Drop src/main & right click on java then select the [mark directory as]() drop down\
  then select [source root]()
- Do the same with scr/main & set test as [test source root]()
